    <p>Located in Papago Park, this garden features one of the world's largest outdoor desert plant collection. A vast array of 
        colorful wildflowers has been strategically placed to create a colorful display and delight visitors in the springtime, and 
        throughout the year. Not only is this park a treat for the eyes, but it also provides exercise for the body and mind. One of 
        the main highlights, an informative ethnobotanical walking trail, meanders through the grounds. The trail explains the many 
        vital ways in which plants were integrated into Native American tribal life, thus illustrating the importance of plants beyond 
        their natural beauty.</p>

    <p>The Japanese Friendship Garden (Ro Ho En, in Japanese) is a traditional Japanese strolling garden and tea house. The garden is
         tucked away on 3.5-acres in downtown Phoenix. The garden features stone footbridges, hand-picked rocks, traditional lanterns, 
         and more than 50 varieties of plants. Many of the flora on display was specially imported from Japan. Visitors can enjoy the 
         serenity of walking alongside flowing streams, a 12-foot waterfall and a Koi pond with more than 300 colorful Koi fish. The 
         garden also regularly hosts traditional tea ceremonies. The garden, which has been open since 2002, is open from October 
         through May.</p>
