        <h2>About our Community</h2>
        <p>It’s no surprise that Frank Lloyd Wright made his winter home in Arizona — it’s easy to be inspired by the region’s natural beauty, diverse culture and perpetual 
        sunshine. His legacy lives on today all across the Phoenix area, where a multitude of buildings bear his influence, and art and design reign supreme. From performing 
        arts to gardens full of succulents, here’s where to go to find your own inspiration in the Valley of the Sun.
